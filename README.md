# Godot Animated Panel Container Plugin GDScript Ver

![Godot v4.x](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-v4.x-%23478cbf?logo=godot-engine&logoColor=white&style=flat-square) 

This plugin will animate size and visibility change in container.

Side notes: It seems that GDScript version is faster than C# version.

C# version is at [GramineaGroup/animated_panel_container_cs](https://github.com/GramineaGroup/animated_panel_container_cs)

Please submit any issues you found. Contribution and suggestions are warmly welcomed.
